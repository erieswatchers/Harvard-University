        <p>John Harvard (born November 1607, London, Eng.—died Sept. 14, 1638, Charlestown [part of Boston], Mass. [U.S.]) was a New England colonist whose bequest permitted the firm establishment of Harvard College. John Harvard was the son of a butcher and of the daughter of a cattle merchant and alderman of Stratford-on-Avon. The plague killed his father and most of his brothers and sisters in 1625. His mother remarried, and John was sent by his mother and stepfather to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1627. He was graduated in 1631 and received a masters degree in 1635. He married in 1636 and sailed for New England the following year.

           <p>Harvard was founded on September 8, 1636. It was the first college in the American colonies. A popular misconception about Harvard University’s name is that John Harvard founded it. The history of Harvard University begins in 1636, when Harvard College was founded in New Towne, a settlement founded six years earlier in colonial-era Massachusetts Bay Colony, one of the original Thirteen Colonies. Two years later, in 1638, New Towne's name was changed to Cambridge.</p>

           <p>Harvard was founded and authorized by the Massachusetts General Court.Harvard University was officially founded by a vote by the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. he legislature of the U.S. state of Massachusetts is known as the General Court. It has a 40-member upper house (Massachusetts Senate) and a 160-member lower house (Massachusetts House of Representatives). Descended from the colonial legislature, the first Massachusetts General Court met in October 1780 and consisted of one-year elected terms for both houses. </p>
